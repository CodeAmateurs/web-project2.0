A Medical Expert System (ES) is a computer program that uses artificial intelligence to emulate  human expertise, aiding in tasks like diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient care.  By so doing,  ES acts in all respects like a human expert, using human knowledge to solve problems that would  require human intelligence.
